  introArticleContent: "A new hope for Civic City! Theodore Ebbing, son of the late
    Marta and Tomas Ebbing, has announced his intention to found [org name here],
    in an attempt to combat increasing poverty and sky-high crime rates. When asked
    about the focus of his organization, Ebbing had this to say: \r\n\u201CYou can\u2019t
    address one without the other. I choose to believe that when people have their
    needs met, they won\u2019t be driven to violent crime.That\u2019s why I don\u2019t
    consider this fortune my own: it belongs to the people of Civic City.\u201D\r\nAndrew
    Taft, at the press conference where he announced his run for mayoral office,
    commented on Ebbing\u2019s announcement, saying: \u201CTed's initiative is noble,
    but misguided. Increased police presence will keep Civic City safe, and might
    even have prevented the tragedy that befell his parents. When I am mayor, I intend
    to increase the law enforcement budget, and nothing of the kind will happen again.\u201D"
