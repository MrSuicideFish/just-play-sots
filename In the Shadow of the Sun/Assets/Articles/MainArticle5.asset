  headline: Police Chief Disarms Bomb Threat
  content: "An already fraught mayoral race turned violent today with police chief
    Andrew Taft\u2019s announcement of a bomb threat delivered to his home. Police
    presence at the dwelling has been increased in response to what Taft says is
    an \u201Cunacceptable\u201D threat to his family. \u201CWe won\u2019t rest until
    we find out who\u2019s responsible.\u201D  Opponent Dr. Sara Trenton, who is
    currently fighting a malpractice lawsuit, decried the action, saying: \u201CEveryone
    deserves peace and security for their family. While violence is never the answer,
    I think of the many families for whom police presence is not a reassurance. When
    I announced my run for mayor, I said that violence begets violence. I stand by
    that statement. My vision for Civic City is one in which all are treated with
    understanding and compassion.\u201D Voters will be able to make their choice
    starting tomorrow. "
