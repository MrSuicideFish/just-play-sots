  headline: Mayoral Race Heats Up
  content: "Dr. Sara Trenton, prominent neurosurgeon at Civic City\u2019s St. Anne
    Hospital, and noted childhood friend of billionaire Ted Ebbing, announced her
    intention today to oppose police chief Andrew Taft\u2019s bid for mayor. \u201CWhen
    I became a doctor,\u201D Trenton said in her statement, \u201CI took an oath
    to do no harm. I firmly believe that violence begets violence. What Civic City
    needs isn\u2019t more police. It\u2019s healing.\u201D Detractors, encouraged
    by Taft himself, point to Trenton\u2019s lack of relevant experience. \u201CDr.
    Trenton has fine ideals,\u201D Taft said when asked for comment. \u201CBut we
    don\u2019t need pie-in-the-sky thinking to save Civic City \u2014 we need strong
    action.\u201D "
