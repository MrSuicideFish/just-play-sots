  headline: Cold Case Defrosted
  content: "Civic City Police announced that an arrest has been made in the decade-old
    case of the slaying of Tom and Marta Ebbing. The killer has been identified as
    Joseph Palin, 41, a former convenience store clerk. Palin was arrested in the
    early hours of the morning, police say, in connection with an unrelated crime.
    \u201CWe got a warrant to search his apartment on suspicion of drug possession,
    and that\u2019s when we found the murder weapon,\u201D said the detective in
    charge of the case. Palin lived in a rooming house and was previously known to
    police. \u201CDrunk and disorderly, we\u2019d gotten calls about him a few times.
    Never anything like this, though.\u201D The trial is set to begin next week. "
