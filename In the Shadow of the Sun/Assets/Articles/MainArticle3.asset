  headline: Massage Parlour Bust Turns Deadly
  subtitle: Worker Shot in Altercation
  content: "Shiawase Beauty Parlour is closed pending a special unit investigation
    of an officer-involved shooting that occurred on the premises late last night.
    Constable Jim Morrow has been named in connection with an arrest that turned
    deadly. Morrow was not able to be reached for comment, but Chief of Police and
    mayoral hopeful Andrew Taft says he is co-operating fully with the investigation.
    \u201CIt\u2019s an outcome we never want to happen,\u201D Taft said, \u201Cbut
    our boys need to protect themselves.\u201D Dr. Sara Trenton, who is running opposite
    Taft, disagreed. \u201CWhat kind of deadly force could have been required at
    a beauty parlour?\u201D she asked. \u201CThere is no death penalty; officers
    of the law are not summary executioners. There is no excuse for what happened
    at Shiawase.\u201D As of writing, there is no indication of why Morrow was present
    at the parlour. He has been suspended with pay, pending the results of the investigation. "
