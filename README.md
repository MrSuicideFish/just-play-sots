# Just Play Game Jam
## In The Shadow of the Sun


You play as a non-profit org (The Org) whose mission is to act on behalf of Citizens / Organizations / Politicians. Each turn, the player is given a new situation that has occurred. The player then chooses how to respond to the situation based on the resources that they have and who they are trying to appease for popularity. After completing 15 Newspaper Events, the game is complete and the player has won. However, if the player runs out of money, the game is over.
